using var keyword to create a variables

let we have a variables name x 
so what our programing do it simply assign some values that we put over that variable x 

if we say or put the value that x=5
and then assign new variable name y where we put the value y=x+5.

so here if want output from the system then it will evaluted the variables and calculate it as y=10 ...


so the main cause of this example is to show that how variables work and what the logic behind it
