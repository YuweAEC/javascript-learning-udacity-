using var keyword to create a variables

let we have a variables name x 
so what our programing do it simply assign some values that we put over that variable x 

if we say or put the value that x=5
and then assign new variable name y where we put the value y=x+5.

so here if want output from the system then it will evaluted the variables and calculate it as y=10 ...


so the main cause of this example is to show that how variables work and what the logic behind it 


In javascript the variables store data as you have seen the way it stored 5 in variable x..
